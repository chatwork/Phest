 <intro>
  This file is used by smarty/docs/scripts/revcheck.php.
  It shows who make part of translation and what are they doing.
  Very important note: The smarty was translated to portuguese before the implementation
  of the revision system, by fernandoc, marcelo and surfmax. And thomasgm made some updates
  after this. Because of this there is no way to give the correct credits for who translated
  which file.
