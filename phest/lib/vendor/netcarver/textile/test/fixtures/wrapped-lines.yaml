Lines are wrapped and line breaks should not be formatted:
  setup:
    - setLineWrap: false

  input:  |
    This line
    wraps to multiple
    lines in the input document, but when
    generated, it *appears*
    as one.

    Paragraphs and *other* formatting options _still_ work regardless, even lists:

    * Item 1
    * Item 2

    And code blocks:

    bc.. Code

    code

  expect: |
    <p>This line wraps to multiple lines in the input document, but when generated, it <strong>appears</strong> as one.</p>

    <p>Paragraphs and <strong>other</strong> formatting options <em>still</em> work regardless, even lists:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Item 1</li>
    	<li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And code blocks:</p>

    <pre><code>Code
