  class: \Netcarver\Textile\Test\Parser\NoUnicode
  input: |
    ...*but you can not actually use UTF-8*

    Since this _test_ can be simulated, these tests can not contain anything
    complicated as the tests will return different results based on the locale,
    compilation locale and the configuration PCRE was compiled with.
